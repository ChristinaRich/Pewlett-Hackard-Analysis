# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:

 Pewlett Hackard expects to lose a tremendous amount of employees to retirement, a phenomenon they're calling a "Silver Tsunami". The purpose of this anaylsis was help prepare the organization for this event by determining the number of retiring employees, sorted by their titles, and by identifying the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.


## Results

The company is anticipating a mass exodus due to the number of employees reaching retirement age. Below are some findings from the analysis:

- This analysis determined that 90,398 employees are retiring soon. 

- These employees are distributed among several job tiles. The table below illustrates this distrubution

- The mentorship program criteria specified that employees must be born in 1965. Given this restraint, 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 

- The table below shows the job titles of these employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Notice that the distribution is different from the distribution of the retiring employees. This means there is a greater gap in mentorship availability in some categories, like Senior Engineers, than others.

## Summary

The Silver Tsunami will ultimately impact 90,398 roles at Pewlett Hackard. Given the vast number of employees expected to retire in the coming years, Pewlett-Hackard needs to prepare to adjust their operations. The company must prepare to hire 90K employees to recover from the loss of manpower, but they must also train current employees and new employees through a mentorship program. Utilizing current employees who have the most experience to mentor junior employees will help prevent massive knowledge loss after the Silver Tsunami. A little more than one nineth of the retiring population is available to mentor junior employees to take on the rolls of these retiring employees. I don't believe there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generagtion of Pewlett Hackard employees, especially Senior Engineers.
