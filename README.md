## Summary

Given the vast number of employees expected to retire in the coming years, Pewlett-Hackard needs to prepare to adjust their operations. The company must either prepare to hire 90K employees to recover from the loss of manpower, but they must also train current employees and new employees through a mentorship program. Utilizing current employees who have the most experience to mentor junior employees will help prevent massive knowledge loss after the Silver Tsunami.
